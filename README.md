# CloseEncounters

Adds a new "Target" action type to PC powers. When used, this action will target all actors within a given radius matching the faction specified in the action.

When you take the target action any existing targets are saved, and the next time you use the action your original targets are restored. When a PC uses this action and then ends their turn, their original targets are automatically restored for them (the GM can disable this in the options menu).

This extension currently supports Dungeons and Dragons 3.5e, 4e, and 5e rulesets, as well as Pathfinder 1e, 2e, and Starfinder.
